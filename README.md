# Considerations

Plan to use this funny guys :

* for NodeJS with Express :
  * lodash : A utility library delivering consistency, customization, performance, & extras. <https://lodash.com>
  * cookie-parser : cookie helper for express <https://github.com/expressjs/cookie-parser>

* for security with node.js : 
  * helmet : for http security <https://www.npmjs.org/package/helmet>
  * passport : Simple, unobtrusive authentication for Node.js <http://passportjs.org/>
  * passport-local : from the previous one for passport's local strategy
  * connect-flash : removed from express4, then...
  * connect-mongo : mongoDB for session storage
